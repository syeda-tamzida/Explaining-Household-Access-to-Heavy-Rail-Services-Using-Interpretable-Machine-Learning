# Explaining-Household-Access-to-Heavy-Rail-Services-Using-Interpretable-Machine-Learning
ML models (RF, SVM, KNN, XGBoost) predict household heavy rail access using NHTS 2022 data. After preprocessing and 5 fold tuning, models reach about 96 percent accuracy. SHAP shows proximity to stations, vehicle availability, and urban density as key drivers, giving interpretable insights for transport policy.
